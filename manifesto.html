<h1>Manifesto</h1>

<h2>Timeline</h2>
In 2001 a group of women going under the name ""The GenderChangers" were giving workshops in the ASCII spoace, one of the first hackerspaces in The Netherlands.

Ivana from Croatia heard about it and invited the group to give their workshops in Pula. They agreed and to do this they picked up glasses at a local bar to collect money.
With the money they hored a large car and drove to Pula. There they gave presentations on Free Software and the Open Source movement, on how a computer works and
on how to make your own website in HTML. One participant had travelled from Athens, Greece to follow the workshop. At the end of the weekend she asked the group if they wanted to
do the same in Athens the next year.

When this was accepted the group thought: we need to give the event a name. After much lateral thinking, brainstorming about the Linux file system and so on, the name Eclectic Tech Carnival aka /ETC was borne.
